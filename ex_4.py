# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a 
# list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor 
# is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 
# 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

number = input("Type your number: ")
dividors = []
for i in range(1, int(number)+1):
    if int(number) % i == 0:
        dividors.append(i)
